## Our Mission

At Trophy Case, we empower you to:

- **Create**: Craft a digital trophy for each of your achievements.
- **Update**: Record new milestones in your journey of success.
- **Delete**: Remove what no longer serves your narrative of progress.

## The Inspiration

Our founder's background in psychology and a passion for tech led to the creation of Trophy Case. Understanding the motivational challenges faced by individuals with ADHD – linked to dopamine levels – our app seeks to bridge the gap between achievement and recognition, providing that much-needed dopamine boost through visual rewards.

## Why Trophy Case?

- **Positive Reinforcement**: A platform based on the principle that celebrating small wins leads to greater motivation.
- **Designed for Focus**: Helps those with ADHD maintain focus with instant gratification for tasks completed.
- **Visual Achievement**: Track and visualize progress in a fun, rewarding way.

## Features

- **Create a Trophy**: Tailor-make trophies to symbolize your personal and professional wins.
- **Update Your Progress**: Adjust and add to your trophies as you reach further milestones.
- **Delete Outdated Goals**: Keep your Trophy Case current by removing what no longer reflects your ambitions.

## A Community of Achievers

Trophy Case is more than an app – it's a community of motivated individuals who celebrate every achievement and inspire each other. Share your story and inspire others to reach their potential.

Join us and let every victory be seen and celebrated. With Trophy Case, you're not just crossing off a list; you're building a legacy of success.
